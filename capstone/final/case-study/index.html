            <div class="content">
                <p>Dear Davis, is a responsive digital platform, accessible from both desktop and mobile phone, where people can anonymously share thoughts they have about Davis — whether it’s a suggestion for improvement, a complaint, or a message of appreciation. The project will allow a visualization of what people think about Davis, highlight concerns and love for the city and hopefully, help build a stronger community.</p>

                <p>The goal of Dear Davis, is to create a platform where people can freely share messages to make Davis better or share what they love about the city with others. The long-term goal is to give a voice to the residents of Davis and increase awareness to unknown aspects that could be improved by the city.</p>
                    
                <p>The target audience for this project are residents (20-40 years old) who enjoy walking and biking around Davis and have great ideas on what could improve the city of Davis.</p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <p>For the comparative research, I’ve explored other digital platforms that had the main goal of visualizing submission from users like Reddit, Tumblr, and PostSecret.</p>
            <div class="content">

                    <h3>Reddit</h3>
                    <img src="images/reddit.png" alt="screeenshot of Reddit webpage">
                    <p>I like the fact that you can scroll and see the main topic of each post while scrolling. And if you decide to comment, a new page opens to show the details of the post and the comments. I like how you can see on the side the recent popular topics, to spark interest of the user.</p>

                    <h3>Tumblr</h3>
                    <img src="images/tumblr.png" alt="screeenshot of Tumblr webpage">
                    <p>I like the simple and effective interaface. The website is not overwhelming and it lets you focus on the main task which is scrolling throught the content and read. I also like the use of icons for interactive actions.</p>

                    <img src="images/postsecret.png" alt="screeenshot of Post Secret webpage">
                    <p>I like the simple and human-like interaface. I like the idea of postcards and handwritten messages. The fun different postcards make the webpage quirky and colorful.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Overall, I’ve noticed a pattern of mainly scrolling interaction to read through the posts. A simple layout and design helps the user to focus more on the content. Like Reddit and Tumblr, I plan to include features to let users interact with other people’s posts.</p>

    <section id="design">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The interface of the project will look like a grassfield with each entry in the form of a flower. The appreciation messages will be in pink while the concerns will be red. In terms of color, I will use a pastel green for the grassfield. For the flowers, I will apply a vibrant red, a pastel pink, and a pastel yellow. In terms of typography, I will use Google Fonts’ Fraunces that will be used for titles and headers to give a human and organic feel to the platform. For body text, I will implement Marcellus (from Google Fonts) for its clarity and elegant characteristics.</p>

                <p>The design palette went through different iterations - the fonts changed from handwritten typefaces to serif and more classy typefaces. The red flowers were also originally supposed to be black scribbles but I figured that using different colored flowers could create the same contrast between the two types of posts and keep a sense of cohesiveness at the same time. </p>

                <p>The layout also changed throughout the process. The position of the “Subimit a thought” button changed from being in the middle to being on the center of each section. I made such a change to solve a glitch that was happening with the javascript, without completely giving up on the split layout.</p>

            <p>During class, I was able to test two students with version 2 of the project.</p>

                <h3>User Test #1</h3>
                <p>Overall, Jennifer found the design calming and cohesive. She liked the choices in type and graphics. She suggested using a faster transition when hovering out of a section. She also to be mindful of the costant look of the cursor as pointer, making everything look interactive even though they might not be. In terms of content, Jennifer suggested to include the date the message was submitted to give the user a temporal context when reading other people's posts.</p>

                <h3>User Test #2</h3>
                <p>Kaelyn thought the design was cute. She liked the design and the textured background. However, she had some issues with the interactions. She thought that the split interface with the hovering interaction was not entirely intuitive. She proposed to have both "submit a thought" buttons visible for the user. She suggested to include an intro page to introduce the user to the project, like in the Figma prototype.</p>

                <p>After the feedback received from the user test session, I will include an introductory page to the project to explain what it is for. If I have more time to further develop the project, I will also include the date of publication to provide the user with a time reference while reading through the posts.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>By working on this project, I learned how to use Back4app, a tool that helps you create the backend of an app. The aspect I’m most proud of is the feature of visualizing entries submitted by different users.</p>

                <p>The most challenging part was creating a split layout and learning how to work with Back4app. The most rewarding aspect is seeing all the entries submitted by the users.</p>
