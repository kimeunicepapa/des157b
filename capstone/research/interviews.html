            <h2>Summary</h2>
            
            <p>
                With the first interview with Maureen Caling, I learned about her, her habits and hobbies, and her opinion of Davis. She told me about her favorite aspects of Davis which are the community and the fact that Davis is a small town. She elaborated on some of the frustrations she encountered while living in the city. She thought the public transportation system could be improved. She experienced discomfort as amenities are far from residencies and she has to arrange a day to run her errands. When she thinks about Davis, the imagery or symbols that come to mind are the cows and nature.

                For the second interview, I asked the same questions listed below to Alexandra Tomita. In her free time, Alexandra enjoys hiking , shopping, trying new foods, and cooking. She has lived in Davis since 2019 when she first decided to go to UC Davis because she liked how friendly, diverse, and small the city is. Regarding the frustrations she encountered in Davis, Alexandra expressed how she wished there were more events, better options for parking on campus,  and a better lighting system at night. The place that reminds her Davis the most is the arboretum while, in terms of symbol, the water tower.

                Both interviewees accessed the web with their phones mostly and they used their laptop for school related activities. Online, they mostly hang out on Instagram and Twitter. Offline, they hang out in the library, cafes, and Cruess hall. To question n. 10, Maureen suggested including a comment section to allow people to have an online discussion about the topic posted. On the other hand,  Alexandra suggested adding categorization for the posts to help users navigate the platform.

                After the interview, I’ve learned that a responsive design should be ideal as many student residents usually access the web with their phones. As a commuter, I also got an insight on the possible complaints Davis residents may have about the city. I found the suggestions would be a great addition to the project. However, I don’t think I have the adequate resources to create such features. Design wise, I think I would have to opt for a more organic and natural feel to reflect Davis’ natural landscape. Overall, the interview became a helpful resource to confirm and update aspects of the project ideation.
