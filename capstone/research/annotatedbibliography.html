            Answer Hunger with Hope is a non-profit website that tries to respond to the issue of global food scarcity and hunger. The website relates to my project as they are both platforms to collect and visualize data. I liked the layout of the website and how it’s divided into videos about the problem and videos of encouragement to the problem. The symmetrical and simple layout is innovative and effective. The website is provided by Compassion, a Christian global network of over 40 countries that serves children and families living in poverty for more than 70 years. I’m considering using the same type of separation into two independent interfaces. The unorthodox layout inspired me to explore more experimental ways to present my data.

            The Design Can… website is a platform to collect ideas about what design can do. Users can submit their own entry by completing the prompt “Design can…”. Each entry can be customized in the form of building and color. The entries can then be seen as part of a perspective view of an illustrated city. The concept of this website is very similar to my project idea — collecting data in the form of text and creating a visually appealing interactive interface to present the data. I think the use of illustrations and mapping of data information is very clever in this website and I want to achieve a similar effect, but as a grassfield of flowers instead. The website is provided by the 20th anniversary of the Hong Kong Design Center. Overall, I think this is the closest website, in terms of design and concept, to what I imagine my project to look like.

            Give a Hand aims to build the world’s largest Open Source image library of hands and ready to be used by AI researchers to build better hand models. The main goal of the website is to create a library that can become a tool to create new learning methods and a translation tool for Sign Language. The website relates to my project because it also collects and visualizes data provided by a community. Give a Hand has a very appealing 3D design and the scrolling intro was very clear and straightforward. I like how the calls to action are easy to spot and to understand. The website is provided by American Society for Deaf Children which is the oldest national organization founded by and governed by parents of deaf children. Although Give a Hand has a beautiful interface, I think the same 3D layout wouldn’t work for data in the form of text because it might be hard to read. Instead, I’m going to strive to achieve the same clarity in the intro explaining the meaning of the website and the calls to action.
