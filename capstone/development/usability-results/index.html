        <h1>Usability Test Results</h1>

            <h2>User Test #1</h2>
            
            <p>
                Overall, Jennifer found the design calming and cohesive. She liked the choices in type and graphics. She suggested using a faster transition when hovering out of a section. She also to be mindful of the costant look of the cursor as pointer, making everything look interactive even though they might not be. In terms of content, Jennifer suggested to include the date the message was submitted to give the user a temporal context when reading other people's posts.

            <h2>User Test #2</h2>
            
            <p>
                Kaelyn thought the design was cute. She liked the design and the textured background. However, she had some issues with the interactions. She thought that the split interface with the hovering interaction was not entirely intuitive. She proposed to have both "submit a thought" buttons visible for the user. She suggested to include an intro page to introduce the user to the project, like in the Figma prototype.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                After the feedback received from the user test session, I will include an introductory page to the project to explain what it is for. I will also include the date of publication to provide the user with a time reference while reading through the posts.
